** Working with TODO items
*** Add TODO to the beginning of any line (after ***) to make it a TODO item
**** TODO this is a fine example of a TODO
*** S-left/right :: cycle workflow
**** #+TODO: TODO IN-PROGRESS WAITING DONE
     Change workflow from default "", TODO, DONE by putting this in doc
***** Do this for all org files on a more permanent basis in Preferences.el
      (setq org-todo-keywords
        '((sequence "TODO" "IN-PROGRESS" "WAITING" "DONE")))
*** C-c / t :: show todos in current document
**** TODO C-c C-v in tutorial dDoesn't work for me...
**** However, C-c / t shows todo's in current document
**** C-c / t :: show todos in current document
     Note that is C-c, then '/', then a 't' (for TODO!)
**** 
** Agendas
*** C-c a :: agenda  // doesn't work for me; can use menu or 'M-x org-agenda'
*** C-c [ :: add document to the list of agenda files
*** C-c ] :: remove document from the list of agenda files
*** C-c . :: add date
**** S-left/right/up/down moves in calendar 
*** C-u C-c . :: add time and date
**** TODO Basics listed under add date, but much more to reference

    http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-custom-agenda-commands.html
** GTD
*** C-c C-c :: add tag
    Tags are used to organize different kind of todo-entries, 
    for example all tasks on the phone, reading, shopping, etc.
**** Also can be done at top of document
     #+TAGS: { @OFFICE(o) @HOME(h) } COMPUTER(c) PHONE(p) READING(r)
***** Refresh after changing "top of document" with C-c C-c on any line starting with #
**** Also can be done emacs-wide in config file (Preferences.el)
     (setq org-tag-alist '(("@work" . ?w) ("@home" . ?h) ("laptop" . ?l)))
**** After you have tags, C-c C-c on a line lets you add them

** TODO Remember orgcard at: http://orgmode.org/orgcard.txt 
* Items below are from messing with tutorial features
* Welcome to org-mode

  Welcome, and thanks for trying out Org-mode. Making outlines in
  org is very simple. It is just text! Just start typing.
* This is a headline, it starts with one or more stars
  A heading has one star, a sub-heading two, etc.
* Working with lists
** Moving around in our outline
** Moving around headlines

* Lord of the Rings
  My favorite scenes are (in this order)
  1. The attack of the Rohirrim
  2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
     + this was already my favorite scene in the book
     + I really like Miranda Otto.
  3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
      - on DVD only
     He makes a really funny face when it happens.
  But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
  Important actors in this film are:
  - Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo
  - Sean Austin :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.  I still remember
    him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in The Goonies.
